# tomoko_toolkits

This is a component UI library for React, all of the components' appearances are derived from [element React](https://github.com/eleme/element-react)<br>
All of the icons are come from [Material-design-icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons)<br>
So it is a personal practice project. It could not be perfect, but I would try to refactor it as time goes by.

## Getting Started

### Install

I don't recomend you to install the dist of this projects,because I haven't finished it, and<br>
there's still no test. So I wouldn't release it to npm. If you have interests, you could read the codes.<br>
And I really hope you can give me any guide and suggestion.

### Basic Info

Now I have finished those Components:
```
    Carousel
    DatePicker
    Input
    PickTable (popover)
    EventRegister
    IDGenerator
    
    ScrollBar (in the progress)
    timePicker (in the progress)
```
